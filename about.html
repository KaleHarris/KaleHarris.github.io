            <p>
                As the name of this website would suggest, my name is Kale Harris. I was 
                born in 1997 in the state of Idaho in the good old U.S.A. My favorite past
                time is playing video games (big surprise, I know), but I also enjoy going out to play
                disc golf or sometimes even regular golf. Also, I like to meet up with a couple
                groups of friends every week to play some Dungeons and Dragons. <br>
                During my time in high school, I had an interest in Engineering and took a
                few classes that gave college credit to get a head start down that path. This
                is also how I discovered that I don't like Engineering at all, and took a 
                year in college with an undeclared major to explore different avenues and 
                still fill in core class requirements in the mean time. <br>
                That is when I eventually found my way to the Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile
                Technology (GIMM) major. What I liked most about the major is that it provides
                students with a portfolio of work right out of college, so that they have something
                to show potential employers as proof that students can do what they claim. I was
                also drawn to the versatility of the knowledge students gain. There are many
                avenues we could take: software development, game development, web development,
                fields involving user experience, digital artistry, or most anything that
                involves the front end side of projects.<br>
                What the major overall tried to prepare us best
