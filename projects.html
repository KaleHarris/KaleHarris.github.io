            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This page is a simple overview of major projects I've completed or been a part of.
                Also included here are projects that either were too small to make an individual web page about or that
                for one reason or another I could not provide much media to showcase them properly.
                If you'd like an in-detail showcase for a project, hover over the Projects button in the navbar above
                and a list of them will appear.
            </p>
            <h3>Orchestra Wars</h3>

                This is a VR game I created in the Unity engine as one of my final projects in college.
                The purpose of it was to more or less simulate the actual process behind developing a game,
                so it takes place over a couple years as students progress through the major. It was also
                a test of my time management skills, as I had to develop it in my own time while other courses
                took place normally. Much more info in the navbar dropdown.
            </p>
            <h3>Slime Hunter</h3>

                Another VR game made during my time in college. However, this one was a group project between
                myself and 3 other students. This project was unique in the way it was developed. As part of the 
                curriculum for the course we were in, each student would switch roles after about a month. The
                original plan was for us to make a new project each month, but with our professor's permission, we
                decided to instead keep developing the same project while still switching roles in our team. Slime
                Hunter is a result of this process. More details on this in the navbar.
