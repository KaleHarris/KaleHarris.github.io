            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Slime Hunter is a simple virtual reality game created within about 2-3 months by
                myself and 3 others as a group project. This project was unique in the way that
                each of us were switching roles between months in the semester. That is to say,
                one person was Project Lead, another was Digital Artist, another was Lead
                Developer/Secondary Tester, and finally Lead Tester/Secondary Developer. The
                intention of structuring the class this way was to give us perspective for each
                role in a real development environment. Originally, we were supposed to make a new
                project each time we switched roles and were given a basic objective to follow for each
                new project. For example, the first objective was to create a game using a state machine.
                However, with our professor's permission, we decided to keep upgrading the same project
                each month and apply any new objectives to it. Thus, Slime Hunter as it is today was the result.<br>
                The game itself is a simple concept. The player is tasked with hunting down pink slimes
                with a sword (or two) to collect slime fuel. Initially, we wanted to have the player desposit
                said fuel into a sort of generator, but that was cut due to time constraints. The player
                is placed in a transparent maze with color coded doors that can be opened or closed.
                Slimes will spawn in the maze randomly and wander around, as well as 2 spiky 
                enemies which will attempt to ram into and disrupt the player. See the gameplay demo
                below for more.

            <h2>My Contribution</h2>
            <p>
                Due to the way our roles rotated around, my contribution to Slime Hunter took isn't
                quite as immediately visible to someone playing the game. I was Project Lead for 
                the first month, and at that point we were still trying to figure out what a Project
                Lead should be doing. That mostly consisted of keeping the others organized and
                accountable for getting their work done each week, and writing and presenting the
                GDD and the project at the end of the month. Next, I was the Lead Tester/Secondary 
                Developer, so I found the most productive thing I could do during that time - aside
                from testing the game when needed - was to create the maze the player navigates and
                program the color coded doors. When the third role change cycle came around, we decided
                to finally move on to a new project, as the objective would be to add multiplayer and 
                we felt that wouldn't work for what Slime Hunter was supposed to be. Before the role
                switch, we took some time to make the game look a bit more pretty; I added materials
                to the maze, others added music, sound, and the skybox.
